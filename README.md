# Investigate a Dataset
Investigate a Dataset - TMDb Movie Data Analysis - TMDb Movie Data Analysis.

We will analyze a dataset for this project and then provide our findings. To facilitate your analysis, we'll use the Python packages NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib.

This data collection includes user reviews and box office figures for 10,000 films that were gathered from The Movie Database (TMDb).

Multiple values are contained in some columns, such as "cast" and "genres," and they are separated by pipe (|) characters.
The connected movie's budget and earnings are displayed in the final two columns that conclude in "_adj," taking inflation into account.
The "cast" section has a few unusual people. They will be dealt with during the data cleansing procedure. TMDb-Movie-Data-Analysis
